# NL-to-SQL
Natural Language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) is an innovative project that seamlessly bridges the gap between natural language commands and SQL queries. It simplifies data manipulation by allowing users to input text or commands in plain English, and then converts those requests into SQL queries using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques powered by the OpenAI API.
